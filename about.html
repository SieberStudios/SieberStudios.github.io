                    <h1>Thank you for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>
                        With more than 6 years experience in many development areas, I realized that I can make great games both for myself and for you. If given the chance I would be able to assist in most any project and can build a game or application from start to finish with great ease. I would like to show you my skills by working alongside you and or your company to make the best possible product together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to visit the other sites I have linked in the top bar as they will lead you to a few of the projects I've made with others and on my own to show you my level skill. You can view those or just look around this site that I had created on my own to showcase my abilities even further.
