                            Tunnel Heli was created over the course of a week with myself and a friend. I created the game mechanics and features while he worked on art and sounds. The final product was submitted to the Weekly Game Jam for review and fun times.

                            Around the World is a mobile game infinite runner game where the player has to avoid the trees along the path as you traverse the world. This was created solely by myself and am working to bring updates to the game to add more fun functionality and popular ideas to make it much, much better.

                            Oh No!! Where's the Tool, was another submission to the Weekly Game Jam. I made it over a week and used only an art pack to help create the game. Mechanics, features, and sounds minus the song were all created by myself and implemented by myself. It's been my most played game so far and the game I feel most proud of being it is popular and the game just felt good to play.

                            Spin Shot is an in progress project at the moment. I've been working on this game to be a challenging zombie style shooter with an in game store feature to be used to advance the player's stats and make the game harder or easier.

                            This picture was a level design practice for myself where I found random pictures online and tried to make something that resembled all the pictures combined. This took me around 3 hours to complete where I used a simple art pack and used this as a disadvantage to make it seem scary and sci fi even with a simple art style.

                            esCape is a mobile game that can be played on desktop or html. It has infinite features that aid in replayability, and a score system to make the player want to keep playing to get a higher score. This game was made from start to finish within one hour as a test to my skills at the time.

                            Rainy Days is one of my more artistic games that I've made. I had a simple idea of the life of a rain drop and decided to make it a game (Why not). The game is from the cloud stage all the way to the rain drop falling to earth to rejoin it's watery breatheren.

                            The building shown below the Full Sail card was something I made on the side while I studied at Full Sail University. The game was supposed to be a RPG game where the player had a time limit to fight within the RPG world to try and defeat the boss. I then turned the boss room into an example of my skills aquired at Full Sail University.

                            The simple layout shown was the beginnings of a project I was lucky enough to be apart of right out of college. This was made under the studio Guardian Studios where I was a level designer that worked his way to lead designer. The tasks were hard but fun and we were able to complete a tech demo to show to producers to try and aid our pursuit in making the game, this fell through and the team members started to drop out and eventually the studio went under as a result.

                            This was the final post of the capstone project while I was at Full Sail University. I worked in a team of 4 designers, 1 producer, and 2 artists. This was made over the course of 4 months all while being judged by peers and graded by industry professionals. We ended our time at Full Sail with an A rating on our project given the time we had on it and the difficulty of the project. No one told students that making a racing battle game would be too much for a short cpastone project, but we turned it around and made it something great and something I am proud to have my name on.
