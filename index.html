                            Deeper unto the Dungeon was created for the Ludum Dare 48 game jam. Made over the course of a single weekend, I worked to ensure the game was as fun as possible working within the constraints provided by the jam. Creating almost all of the code within 72 hours was definitely a challenge but I was able get the game completed in time to be able to showcase it with the other games. I recieved quite a bit of feedback for this game which was a great help, as I've since taken the feedback and incorporated it into the game to make it even better and I've also added and reworked the game since the release as well.

                            Scenic Sprint was a game created within a weekend for myself to grow as a game developer and designer. The point of the game was to induce rage with slightly visible obstacles and an only forward moving platform.

                            Demon Arena was made over the course of 2 months with the aid of an audio designer. Together we created this arena style shooter where the player spawns into a generated map based off of premade sprites. To win the player had to make it through all the levels by killing all the demons as they spawned. The game was created for a bundle sale on itch.io with several other games that can still be purchased today.

                            Horror Story Writer is a typing game that was made over the course of a month to be sold in a locally sourced bundle on itch. I worked with an audio designer to add more atmosphere and fear to the game. As the player types out the story they start to feel as though they are becoming one with the story.

                            Around the World is a mobile game infinite runner game where the player has to avoid the trees along the path as you traverse the world. This was created solely by myself and am working to bring updates to the game to add more fun functionality and popular ideas to make it much, much better.

                            Oh No!! Where's the Tool, was another submission to the Weekly Game Jam. I made it over a week and used only an art pack to help create the game. Mechanics, features, and sounds minus the song were all created by myself and implemented by myself. It's been my most played game so far and the game I feel most proud of being it is popular and the game just felt good to play.

                            Tunnel Heli was created within a week with an artist where we worked together to create a 3D recreation of the old helicopter browser game. This game differs with power-up features that will help or hurt the player depending on how they play.

                            This picture was a level design practice for myself where I found random pictures online and tried to make something that resembled all the pictures combined. This took me around 3 hours to complete where I used a simple art pack and used this as a disadvantage to make it seem scary and sci fi even with a simple art style.

                            esCape is a mobile game that can be played on desktop or html. It has infinite features that aid in replayability, and a score system to make the player want to keep playing to get a higher score. This game was made from start to finish within one hour as a test to my skills at the time.

                            Rainy Days is one of my more artistic games that I've made. I had a simple idea of the life of a rain drop and decided to make it a game (Why not). The game is from the cloud stage all the way to the rain drop falling to earth to rejoin it's watery breatheren.

                            This was the final post of the capstone project while I was at Full Sail University. I worked in a team of 4 designers, 1 producer, and 2 artists. This was made over the course of 4 months all while being judged by peers and graded by industry professionals. We ended our time at Full Sail with an A rating on our project given the time we had on it and the difficulty of the project. No one told students that making a racing battle game would be too much for a short cpastone project, but we turned it around and made it something great and something I am proud to have my name on.
